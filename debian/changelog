    And do touch-file on exit.
  * Do aggressive conflicts as extra safety.
  * Fix paths. Thanks Lisandro.
  * Fix up what you can/can't do in case of errors. Give possibility to
    continue anyways.

    selected set of options).
  * Be more verbose in the MigrationPage about selected options.
  * Fix layouting of ChoicePage (more stable).
  * Add myself to debian/copyright as author.

    configuration files that are in ~/.kde/share/config.
