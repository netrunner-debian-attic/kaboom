kaboom (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET (final version will be 1.1.0).

  +++ Changes by Sune Vuorela:

  * Let us go live with kaboom. Default to .kde and .kde4. 
    And do touch-file on exit.
  * Do aggressive conflicts as extra safety.
  * Fix paths. Thanks Lisandro.
  * Fix up what you can/can't do in case of errors. Give possibility to
    continue anyways.
  
  +++ Changes by Modestas Vainius:

  * Tell a user when kaboom does not need to do anything (as per
    selected set of options).
  * Be more verbose in the MigrationPage about selected options.
  * Fix layouting of ChoicePage (more stable).
  * Add myself to debian/copyright as author.
  * Change default kaboom stamp path to ~/.local/kaboom.
